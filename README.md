First I tried to develope some research into how to create a pool table web game on a website for you all to enjoy.
Next I decided on what I will need to add and what other neccesitiies will I need for this web game to succeed.
Then I started developing the html and the css pages for web to work and also make the table on the browser.
After that has been completed, I got started on making the balls and the holes for my pool table.
After that I started writing code for the balls to when they collide to each other, they should move in the opposite directions from each other.
After that I draw a stick above the table so that the stick does go behind the table. I want to players who will enjoy this game to have the experience to interact the keyboard controls to control the stick so that they can hit the balls in any direction.
This is the first time I have ever come up with this kind of idea. So it was pretty complex to start this code from scratch and get it working on people you play this game.
